    <h2>Arguments</h2>
    <dl><dt>sim</dt>
<dd><p>Simulation from <code><a href="sim_distribution.html">sim_distribution</a></code></p></dd>
<dt>n_sims</dt>
<dd><p>Number of surveys to simulate over the simulated population. Note: requesting
a large number of simulations may max out your RAM. Use
<code><a href="sim_survey_parallel.html">sim_survey_parallel</a></code> if many simulations are required.</p></dd>
<dt>q</dt>
<dd><p>Closure, such as <code><a href="sim_logistic.html">sim_logistic</a></code>, for simulating catchability at age
(returned values must be between 0 and 1)</p></dd>
<dt>trawl_dim</dt>
<dd><p>Trawl width and distance (same units as grid)</p></dd>
<dt>resample_cells</dt>
<dd><p>Allow resampling of sampling units (grid cells)? Setting to TRUE may introduce bias
because depletion is imposed at the cell level.</p></dd>
<dt>binom_error</dt>
<dd><p>Impose binomial error? Setting to FALSE may introduce bias in stratified estimates
at older ages because of more frequent rounding to zero.</p></dd>
<dt>min_sets</dt>
<dd><p>Minimum number of sets per strat</p></dd>
<dt>set_den</dt>
<dd><p>Set density (number of sets per [grid unit] squared). WARNING:
may return an error if <code>set_den</code> is high and
<code>resample_cells = FALSE</code> because the number of sets allocated may
exceed the number of cells in a strata.</p></dd>
<dt>lengths_cap</dt>
<dd><p>Maximum number of lengths measured per set</p></dd>
<dt>ages_cap</dt>
<dd><p>If <code>age_sampling = "stratified"</code>, this cap represents the maximum
number of ages to sample per length group (defined using the <code>age_length_group</code>
argument) per division or strat (defined using the <code>age_space_group</code> argument)
per year. If <code>age_sampling = "random"</code>, it is the maximum number of ages to sample
from measured fish per set.</p></dd>
<dt>age_sampling</dt>
<dd><p>Should age sampling be "stratified" (default) or "random"?</p></dd>
<dt>age_length_group</dt>
<dd><p>Numeric value indicating the size of the length bins for stratified
age sampling. Ignored if <code>age_sampling = "random"</code>.</p></dd>
<dt>age_space_group</dt>
<dd><p>Should age sampling occur at the "division" (default), "strat" or "set" spatial scale?
That is, age sampling can be spread across each "division", "strat" or "set"
in each year to a maximum number within each length bin (cap is defined using
the <code>age_cap</code> argument). Ignored if <code>age_sampling = "random"</code>.</p></dd>
<dt>custom_sets</dt>
<dd><p>Supply an object of the same structure as returned by <code><a href="sim_sets.html">sim_sets</a></code> which
specifies a custom series of set locations to be sampled. Set locations are
automated if <code>custom_sets = NULL</code>.</p></dd>
<dt>light</dt>
<dd><p>Drop some objects from the output to keep object size low?</p></dd>

    <h2>Value</h2>
    <p>A list including rounded population simulation, set locations and details
and sampling details. Note that that N = "true" population, I = population available
to the survey, n = number caught by survey.</p>
