## Introduction

### Fisheries-independent surveys

<div style="float: left; width: 50%;">

- Conducted by many RFMOs
- Becoming increasingly important in stock assessment
- Associated with difficult questions:
    - How many fish are in the sea?
    - Where are they located?
    - How should we sample the population?
    - How should we analyze these data?

## Core functions

### `sim_abundance`

```{r sim-abundance, exercise = TRUE, exercise.eval = FALSE}
set.seed(438)
long <- sim_abundance(ages = 1:20,
                      R = sim_R(log_mean = log(3e+07)),
                      Z = sim_Z(log_mean = log(0.2)))
short <- sim_abundance(ages = 1:6,
                       R = sim_R(log_mean = log(1e+10)),
                       Z = sim_Z(log_mean = log(0.8)))
```
